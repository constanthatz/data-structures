#data-structures

###This repository holds sample code for a number of data structures implemented with python.

*Feb 4th, 2015* - Added a Linked List structure in Python. Has classes for each node, as well as the structure itself. Includes functionality for:
                      <p>insert(value): Inserts the given value at the front of the list</p>
                      <p>pop(): Removes the front value from the list and returns that to the user</p>
                      <p>size(): Returns the size (number of nodes) in a list</p>
                      <p>search(value): Searches a list for a given value, if found, returns the node</p>
                      <p>remove(node): If the given node exists, removes it from the list.</p>
                      <p>display(): Displays the string formatted list as a tuple.</p>
                      <p>__repr__: Same as display, but can be called by just inputting the name of the list</p>
                  <p>Each of these functions has tests to ensure they are working as expected.</p>

*Feb 5th, 2015* - Added a stack sturcture in Python. Has a class for an element of the stack, as well as the stack stucture itself. Includes functionality for:
                      <p>push(value): Adds the value at to top of the stack</p>
                      <p>pop(): Removes the top element from the stack and returns it.</p>
                  <p>Each of these functions has tests to ensure they are working as expected.</p>
