#data-structures

###This repository holds sample code for a number of data structures implemented with python.

*Feb 4th, 2015* - Added a Linked List structure in Python. Has classes for each node, as well as the structure itself. Includes functionality for:
                      <ul>
                      <li>insert(value): Inserts the given value at the front of the list</li>
                      <li>pop(): Removes the front value from the list and returns that to the user</li>
                      <li>size(): Returns the size (number of nodes) in a list</li>
                      <li>search(value): Searches a list for a given value, if found, returns the node</li>
                      <li>remove(node): If the given node exists, removes it from the list.</li>
                      <li>display(): Displays the string formatted list as a tuple.</li>
                      <li>__repr__: Same as display, but can be called by just inputting the name of the list</li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>Each of these functions has tests to ensure they are working as expected.</p>
*Feb 5th, 2015* - Added a stack structure in Python. Has a class for an element of the stack, as well as the stack stucture itself. Includes functionality for:
                      <ul>
                      <li>push(value): Adds the value at to top of the stack</li>
                      <li>pop(): Removes the top element from the stack and returns it.</li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>Each of these functions has tests to ensure they are working as expected.</p>
*Feb 6th, 2015* - Added the "Proper Parenthetics" Interview Challenge with functionality for:
                      <ul>
                      <li>Return 1 if a string has unclosed parentheticals</li>
                      <li>Return 0 if a string is balanced - All parenthases closed</li>
                      <li>Return -1 if a string has closed parenthases that were not opened</li>
                      </ul>
